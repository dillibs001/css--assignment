                    <p>Hi, I’m Dillibe! I am from Enugu, Nigeria, and I’m currently a student at the University of
                        Nigeria, Enugu Campus.</p>
                    <p>I’m passionate about web design and development, and I enjoy creating clean, modern layouts with
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, coding personal projects, and playing football with friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly learning new web technologies to
                        improve my craft.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and eventually build applications that solve
                        real-world problems in healthcare and education.</p>
